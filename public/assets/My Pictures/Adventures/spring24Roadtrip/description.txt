This was most definitely the best road trip I have been on in my entirely life. 

It was an incredible journey across the Southwest United States! We covered over 2,500 miles in just 9 days, camping out almost every night, showering at gas stations, cooking our own food, and visiting some of the most breathtaking national parks and landscapes.

Locations:
- Overland Park, Kansas (Origin)
- Estes Park, Colorado (To pick up one of our friends from his job)
- Pahranagat National Wildlife Refuge, Nevada (Where we had our first night of camping)
- Las Vegas, Nevada
- Grand Canyon, Arizona
- Monument Valley, Arizona/Utah border
- Arch Canyon, Utah 
- Santa Fe, New Mexico 
- Estes Park, Colorado (Dropping friend back off)

This was my very first time visiting the American Southwest and it was one I will never ever forget. 

Best memories:
- The sunrises and sunsets at every location 
- Cooking bacon pancakes at the Grand Canyon
- The first shower in a 4 days at a Love's gas station
- Being an absolute doofus with my best friends in the middle of nowhere
- The friendly dog at the campsite in Monument Valley
- Finding natural cave in the cliff-face with a perfect outlook of the Valley
