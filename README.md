# Windows XP Portfolio Site

## Project Overview
This project is a portfolio website that authentically simulates the Windows XP desktop environment. It features draggable and resizable windows, desktop icons, a taskbar, and a contact formâ€”all styled to match the classic XP look and feel. The site is fully interactive, persistent, and mobile responsive, providing a nostalgic yet modern showcase for your work and contact information.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a unique, memorable, and interactive way to present my professional background, projects, and contact information. By emulating the Windows XP desktop, I tried to offer visitors a playful and engaging experience that stands out from traditional portfolio sites.

- **Authentic Windows XP UI**: Desktop icons, taskbar, windows, and controls
- **Draggable & Resizable Windows**: About, Projects, and Contact windows can be moved and resized
